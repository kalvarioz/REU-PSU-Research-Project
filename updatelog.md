# A Topology-Based Framework for Assessing the Statistical Robustness of Multi-Layer Coastal Infrastructures - Update log from beginning to end.

## 6/23 - began reading on certain papers, Betti numbers, the use of abnormal cases and attacks on nodes using tology based modeling.

Im pretty new to these topics, i should definitely do some looking into what betti numbers are and their roles in whatever im reading as they appear somewhat frequently.

R seems like an interesting language, some aspects of C and python maybe, ill need to get some more training on this.

## 6/24 - Tested out some R code, Tried using some multinet, but the tool was causing many errors.

Bit of a stressful day, lots of code wasnt running well, but ill try a solution tomorrow

## 6/25 - Translating to python and trying again

I translated most of the code to Python and crated some simple programs which worked, so that neat, i also was able to get a hold of some sourecs to create networks, I tried out R's visnetwork and i graph, and i was able to create a neat little graph with nodes pointing to each other, kind of tapping into that part where we need to see where sources are dependent on certain networks.

## 6/26 - Reading on more documents, waiting on faculty mentor to post some R programs to view

Ill continue on trying out some network tools, Im thinking of trying to place these network nodes on a real map to show the cascading effects eventually, at the moment, i am trying out OpenStreetMap and QGIS to see what i can do with these tools. Ill try to create a simulation for California first, but then i want to try to do an almost global graph..
