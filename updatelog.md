# A Topology-Based Framework for Assessing the Statistical Robustness of Multi-Layer Coastal Infrastructures - Update log from beginning to end.

## 6/23 - began reading on certain papers, Betti numbers, the use of abnormal cases and attacks on nodes using tology based modeling.

Im pretty new to these topics, i should definitely do some looking into what betti numbers are and their roles in whatever im reading as they appear somewhat frequently. I have began to look into the new program that i will be writing in, which will be R.

R seems like an interesting language, some aspects of C and python maybe, ill need to get some more training on this.

I was able to find a few papers based on the topic of resilience based on extreme events and such, i havent gone to in depth into each one, but reading the abstracts look promising.

## 6/24 - Tested out some R code, Tried using some multinet, but the tool was causing many errors.

Bit of a stressful day, lots of code wasnt running well, 

Im currently trying out QGIS, Multinet, and some mapping tools to try and get the database of power plants to appear on that map.

Program is causing some issues, despite restarting, so ill probably continue to read though some papers until the end of the day.

## 6/25 - Translating to python and trying again

Based on my progress from yesterday, i decided to translate some of the graphing code and 3D functions to Python and crated some simple programs which worked, so thats neat, i also was able to get a hold of some sourecs to create networks, I tried out R's visnetwork and i graph, and i was able to create a neat little graph with nodes pointing to each other, kind of tapping into that part where we need to see where sources are dependent on certain networks.

With some transalting, i got the hang of it a little bit, i actually got a mini network to appear using R's visNetwork, Awesome!!

Although its just a simulation with some practice data, i think this is a pretty big move.

I have begun to try out some other tools, ggplot2, sf, rnaturalearth, osmdata, dplyr, mapview.

## 6/26 - Reading on more documents, waiting on faculty mentor to post some R programs to view

Ill continue on trying out some network tools, Im thinking of trying to place these network nodes on a real map to show the cascading effects eventually, at the moment, i am trying out OpenStreetMap and QGIS to see what i can do with these tools. Ill try to create a simulation for California first, but then i want to try to do an almost global graph..


To my surprise, we got something working amazingly, this was able to be generated using an osm file, but the nodes are expanding thoughout the coast of the state, the problem might be the power lines, as theyre highlighting every road, even freeways, which im not sure should be correct, at the moment they're only covering the area in which i downloaded the .osm file for, im also guessing its locating underground power lines, which is otherwise fine.

## 6/27 - Writing Presentation on key paper

im diving farther into the reasearch paper my faculty mentor has provided me, i plan to present this on Tuesday, July 1st, so far im starting to understand the concepts, but i need to look into the mathy stuff more.

I finished up the day with reading and really diving into the paper that Dr. Dorcas provided me, there are alot of cool therories that i have been reading on based on the paper, like the vietoris rips complex and simplices leading into Betti numbers. Next week i will finish up my presentation for the key paper i found.


## 6/30 - Finishing presentation on key paper

Today im working on finishing the presentation as mentioned beforehand, once i present and finish up with that, ill begin to look at papers that actually dive into the aspects of extreme weather or disasters. If possible, i hope Dr. Dorcas can provide me the code from R so i can have a better, general idea of what to program..

## 7/1 - Reading through key paper presentation

## 7/2 - Found a SUPER key paper, this has a lot of similarties of what i am planning on, and i can create something possibly more advanced..
